My research interests include deep learning, AI in healthcare, and other interdisciplinary applications of AI. 

My current research area is reinforcement learning for programming languages and systems.

I also have a background in full-stack web development, cybersecurity, and dealing with data. 

Three potential topics I'd be interested in working on are:

(1) Reinforcement learning

(2) AI in healthcare

(3) AI in cybersecurity 

I have not yet teamed up with anyone.
